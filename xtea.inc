;
;	Implementation of XTEA (new varient of TEA) in 32 bit x86 assembly language
;
;	The code is a direct translation of ANSI C version, and commented with
;	pieces of the original C code for those interested, and hence should be 
;	straightforward. The code is not supposed to be optimized, but I think little 
;	(if anything) can be done to optimize it. It is much simpler than 16 bit
;	version, as the algorithm is designed for 32 bit CPUs, and there are enough
;	registers to avoid using stack or temporary memories.
;
;	Initially used as inline code in a VC++ program and then modified for use 
;	with MASM, but it should be very easy to modify it for other assemblers.
